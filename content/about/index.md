I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of
Combinatorics and Optimization] and the [Institute for
Quantum Computing] at the [University of Waterloo]. I am
interested in the theory of quantum computing, quantum
algorithms and quantum complexity theory.

**Please contact me if you are interested in joining my
group as a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow**. I can
be reached by email at dgosset at uwaterloo dot ca.

Previously I was a research staff member and manager of the
Theory of Quantum Algorithms group at the [IBM T.J. Watson
Research Center]. Before joining IBM I held postdoctoral
fellowships at IQC/Waterloo, and at [Caltech]. I completed my
PhD in Physics in 2011 at [MIT] under the supervision of
[Eddie Farhi]. I did my undergraduate degree in physics and
math at [UBC].
