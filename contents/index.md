![David Gosset](img/dgossetIQC_sm.jpg)

I am an postdoctoral fellow at the [Institute for Quantum Computing] and
the [Department of Combinatorics and Optimization] at the [University of Waterloo]
(currently supervised by [Andrew Childs] and [Michele Mosca]).

I completed my PhD in Physics in 2011 at [MIT] under the supervision of
[Eddie Farhi].

Before that, I did my undergraduate degree in physics and math at [UBC].

I am interested in quantum algorithms, quantum walks, Hamiltonian
complexity theory, and other areas in quantum computation and quantum
information.

I can be reached by email at dngosset at gmail dot com.
